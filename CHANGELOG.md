# Changelog

## v0.1.0

The first release provides a local knowledge service with one command, automatic source updates and precompiled installation.

- `rag` unifies initialization, indexing, querying, conversion, evaluation, Agent registration and service management. `ragd`, `ragctl`, `ragprep` and `rageval` remain available.
- `rag init` checks embedding dimensions and the selected PDF backend, stores credentials separately with mode `0600`, and enables automatic refresh for new stores.
- `rag connect claude/codex` registers HTTP MCP through the official clients, with idempotency and explicit replacement of conflicting entries.
- macOS LaunchAgent and Linux user systemd services use absolute paths and load credentials in the background.
- Tracked directories refresh automatically with recursive watching, debounce and retry. PDFs use the configured Poppler, GROBID or MinerU backend and retain source/page provenance.
- Original-to-canonical mappings prevent duplicate PDF ingestion and cached conversions reappearing after source deletion. Failed conversions retain the existing index; removing a tracked root preserves documents covered by other roots.
- macOS/Linux arm64/amd64 archives include all five binaries, built with CGO, SQLite FTS5 and sqlite-vec. The installer verifies SHA-256 checksums; the Homebrew Tap provides a Cask.

Existing stores keep manual refresh until explicitly enabled. Legacy TypeScript stores require read-only mode. External embedding services and PDF engines are configured separately; Linux archives require glibc.

Validation includes race tests, vet, native archives on all four platforms, real Poppler PDF ingestion/deletion, macOS/Linux service lifecycle and actual Codex MCP retrieval. GROBID/MinerU tests validate their protocols; real extraction quality, Claude retrieval and login/reboot behavior require separate acceptance.
